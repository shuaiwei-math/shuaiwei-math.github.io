It is about boundary control method in 1D
Dynamical Inverse Problems. The p.d.f. file can be found <a href="../../../assets/pdf/pde.pdf">here</a>.

This presentation first discusses certain results related to the calculation of differential operators in the context of reduced monomial rings. Subsequently, it presents some results pertaining to differential operators in non-reduced monomial rings.
