    For $$x \in \mathbb N$$,
    \begin{equation}
        \pi(x) = \sharp\, \\{p = x \mid p \text{ is prime}\\}. 
    \end{equation}
    Then
    \begin{equation}
        \pi(x) \sim \int_2^{x} \frac{1}{\ln t}dt,
    \end{equation}
    which is the prime number theory. The concept map and proof process can be seen from: <a href="../../../assets/pdf/conceptMap.pdf">Concept Map</a>
