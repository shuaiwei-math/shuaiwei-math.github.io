Since July 2022, I've held a postdoctoral position within the Mathematics and Statistics department at the University of New Mexico. I pursued my math Ph.D. in Clemson University under the guidance of <a href="https://ssather.people.clemson.edu/">Dr. Keri Ann Sather-Wagstaff</a>, focusing on the field of combinatorial commutative algebra. Currently, my research is centered on commutative algebra and differential operators, and I am fortunate to be working alongside <a href="https://math.unm.edu/~jvassil/">Dr. Janet Vassilev</a> in this exciting endeavor.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
