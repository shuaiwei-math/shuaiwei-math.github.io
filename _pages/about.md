Since July 2022, I've held a postdoctoral position within the Mathematics and Statistics department at the University of New Mexico. I pursued my math Ph.D. in Clemson University under the guidance of <a href="https://ssather.people.clemson.edu/">Dr. Keri Ann Sather-Wagstaff</a>, focusing on the field of combinatorial commutative algebra. Currently, my research is centered on commutative algebra and differential operators, and I am fortunate to be working alongside <a href="https://math.unm.edu/~jvassil/">Dr. Janet Vassilev</a> in this exciting endeavor.

 My research interests lie in and around commutative algebra, with emphasis on its connections to other fields. I currently investigate applications of combinatorics to problems in commutative algebra.
